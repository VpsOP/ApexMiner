# PocketMine-MP Autominers


This plugin was created in my free time as an attempt to make a fully working PocketMine plugin.
I have tested this out on local server with single player on. If you want to use this plugin in your own server then kindly take some time for testing

## How to use

You can download the phar file [here](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/VpsOP/ApexMiner/ApexMiner)

This plugin has only one command `/miner [int:count] [int:level] [string:player]` and a permission for this command `apexminer.command.miner`

That's all you need to know to use this plugin


### Issues

If you found any issues with this plugin then kindly open an issue. I will try my best to fix that.
