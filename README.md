# PocketMine-MP Autominers

This plugin adds autominers to your Pocketmine-MP server

## How to use

You can download the phar file [here](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/VpsOP/ApexMiner/ApexMiner)

This plugin has only one command `/miner [int:count] [int:level] [string:player]` and a permission for this command `apexminer.command.miner`

That's all you need to know to use this plugin

## How miners work?

Run the command. It will give you a miner. Place the miner over Cobble generator or any other type of block generator then put a chest over the miner. That's all, now miner will mine the block below it and put the drops in the chest over it.
