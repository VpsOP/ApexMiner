# PocketMine-MP Autominers


This plugin was created in my free time as an attempt to make a fully working PocketMine plugin.
I have tested this out on local server with single player on. If you want to use this plugin in your own server then kindly take some time for testing

## How to use

Download the source code of the plugin and convert into .phar format and put the genrated .phar file in your server's plugin folder

This plugin has only one command `/miner [int:count] [int:level] [string:player]` and a permission for this command `apexminer.command.miner`

That's all you need to know to use this plugin


### Issues

If you found any issues with this plugin then kindly open an issue. I will try my best to fix that.
